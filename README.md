> A simple yet engaging text-based RPG adventure

This project is a text-based RPG game where you are the main character (The Hero). After being introduced to the back-story, you'll navigate through different locations, fight monsters, and make decisions (attack, retreat, use an item, do nothing, etc), while managing your resources (i.e. stats such as XP, health, gold, and Orbs).

## Game Overview

In a medieval fantasy world, players embark on a journey filled with constant decision-making, where every choice has its risks and rewards. From setting up camp in the wilderness to deciding how much gold to carry, players must weigh their options carefully to survive and thrive.

## Key Features

- **Exploration:** Travel through various locations, each with unique challenges and opportunities.
- **Combat:** Engage in turn-based battles with a variety of monsters.
- **Resource Management:** Manage health, gold, and inventory to ensure survival.
- **Decision Making:** Constant risk/reward choices that impact the game's outcome.

## Immediate Roadmap

1. **Expand Locations:** Add more locations with distinct characteristics and challenges.
2. **Develop Camping Mechanics:** Introduce benefits and risks to setting up camp, such as health regeneration, reconnaisance for helpful information, versus exposing yourself to surprise attacks and potential ambushes.
3. **Implement Resource Management:** Allow players to manage gold and inventory, introducing decisions on spending and saving.

## Mid-term Roadmap

1. **Enhance Monster Variety:** Continue adding monsters and beasts to contend with, as well as scenario and/or location-bound enemies.
2. **Introduce Monster Cards:** Implement collectible cards that display on-screen representations of monsters, boost experience and wisdom, and reveal monsters' weaknesses as players collect more cards.
3. **Develop Trading System:** Introduce traveling traders and the option to buy and sell items.

## Future Roadmap

1. **Incorporate Story Elements:** Introduce a storyline, centered around the Orbs, (possibly) with quests, NPCs, and character development.
2. **Add a SAVE feature:** Explore options for how to incorporate the user's local storage.
3. **Introduce Dynamic Events:** Implement events that change the game world, such as seasonal changes, different Orb-count milestones, or world events.

## Development Principles

- **Playability:** Ensure the game remains playable and enjoyable at all stages of development.
- **Player Feedback:** Regularly gather and incorporate player feedback to improve the game.
- **Incremental Updates:** Implement updates in small, manageable increments to maintain game stability.
